# Summary
Examples of connecting to and interacting with various Bluetooth profiles for a phone.

# Examples
All examples are intentionally verbose to provide the most amount of detail in how interacting with a profile works.

## Phonebook Profile
The phonebook example connects to a device, requests access to the "phonebook access profile" (PBAP), pulls contacts, then disconnects. </ br>

NOTE: this is still a work in progress as there is an issue parsing a response message in the PBAP response I believe. </ br>

## Message Profile
Working on it.
